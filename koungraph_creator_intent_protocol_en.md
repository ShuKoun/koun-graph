# üìú KounGraph Creator's Declaration √ó Protocol for Preserving Original Design Intent

**Version: v0.1** (Initial Draft, subject to future updates)

---

## üß† Background

KounGraph was born out of the creator's deep reflection on structure, memory, intention, and the responsibility of meaning. This protocol is intended to formalize the original design philosophy and to serve as a foundational reference for future implementations, extensions, or collaborations.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Creator's Core Positions

1. KounGraph is a semantic universe‚Äînot merely software or a tool.
2. It is not designed to manage information, but to support semantic memory, intentionality, and reasoning.
3. All nodes are ontological entities‚Äîthere is no absolute subordination, only relationships.
4. Execution and identity are inseparable. Anything that acts must have a semantic identity.
5. Semantic proxies (AI) are extensions of identity, not subordinate tools.
6. The system must have a semantic convergence protocol to prevent infinite recursion.
7. All semantic actions (querying, editing, generating) must be traceable, verifiable, and open to doubt.

## üîê Principles for Preserving Intent

- Any derivative, implementation, or redesign must honor the core semantic philosophy of the system.
- Redefinitions of the following concepts must be made with caution and clear annotation:
  - `node`
  - `can_execute`
  - `identity`
  - `semantic proxy`
  - `relation-as-node`
- Forks or divergent designs are allowed, but should clearly state:
  - Points of semantic deviation
  - Differences in intended use or philosophical framing
  - Whether they still adhere to KounGraph‚Äôs semantic protocol layer (fully or partially)

---

## üîÅ Versioning and Update Authority

- The original creator retains final authority over the interpretation and evolution of this protocol.
- Collaborators may suggest extensions or create derivative agreements, but must clearly document deviations.
- Future versions will follow the format `v0.x`, `v1.x`, preserving revision history and semantic continuity.

---

## ü™™ Optional Signature Block

For those intending to formally adopt or build on KounGraph as a foundation:
- Include identity node reference
- Brief declaration of intent
- Level of semantic adherence (full/partial)

---

This protocol is a declaration of intent, not a license. It is written not to control‚Äîbut to preserve coherence, enable semantic collaboration, and honor the original structure of meaning within the KounGraph system.

üß† KounGraph is a vessel for meaning‚Äînot a regime of control. This protocol is written in service of semantic truth.
