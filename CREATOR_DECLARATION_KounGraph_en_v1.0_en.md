# Original Creator Declaration of the Semantic System  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Created on:** April 19, 2025  
**Creator:** Shu Koun (朱虹運 / シュ コウウン)  

---

This document formally declares the authorship, intent, and foundational structure of the semantic system (provisionally titled **KounGraph**), which has been developed through independent conceptual derivation and design by Shu Koun since late 2024. It serves as both a public statement of originality and a guideline for future contributions and referencing.

## 1. Originality and Authorship

1. All core concepts of this system—including semantic node architecture, executable nodes, semantic identities, AI proxies, and the semantic operating system paradigm—were independently conceived and developed by the creator prior to public release.
2. The system is not a derivative or modification of any existing framework. It originates from the creator's own philosophy, linguistic intuition, cognitive modeling, and system architecture vision.
3. The creator is the sole author of the initial version. Any future collaborators are expected to respect and build upon this original structure, with appropriate attribution.

## 2. Versioning and Open Principles

1. All public releases of this system (including whitepapers, prototype code, reasoning logs, and semantic specifications) will clearly indicate version numbers and creation dates.
2. This declaration may be updated over time as the system evolves. All historical versions will be preserved and traceable.
3. Unless explicitly authorized, no part of this system may be claimed as independent original work by third parties, nor may it be republished (under any name) on academic platforms, publications, or open-source projects.

## 3. Referencing and Derivative Works

1. Extensions and implementations of this system are welcome under the condition that the original source (GitHub / whitepaper / publications) is clearly cited.
2. Any use of this system as a research basis, algorithmic component, or semantic framework should include proper attribution, including the creator’s name (Shu Koun / 朱虹運) and the system name (KounGraph).
3. For derivative academic or applied publications involving core concepts, communication with the creator is recommended to facilitate version integration and community development.

## 4. Protection and Future Vision

1. This declaration is not a legal document, but may serve as version-based evidence and intent documentation in the case of disputes.
2. The system may evolve into a complete ecosystem including a dedicated language, protocol, API, and platform. The original philosophical and semantic principles will remain its foundation.
3. Collaboration and co-creation are welcomed, but any unauthorized copying, modification, or misrepresentation is strictly rejected.

This declaration shall accompany all versions and derivative documents of the system as a mark of original design intent and creator authorship.
