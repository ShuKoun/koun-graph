## 🧠 About Me

I am an independent system designer and cognitive systems thinker based in Japan. I specialize in the design of semantic structures that bridge human cognition and machine reasoning. Over the past year, I have designed and documented a full architectural framework called **KounGraph**, a Semantic Operating System that reimagines how memory, reasoning, identity, and AI interaction can be modeled using meaning as the foundation.

Though I do not hold formal AI credentials, my self-directed research has resulted in a system that combines philosophical clarity with practical structure: multi-layered semantic graphs, AI proxy architectures, cryptographic identity layers, and modular, portable runtime environments. I am now seeking to join an organization that values semantic alignment, cognitive depth, and long-term vision.

## 🧩 Key Project

### KounGraph — A Semantic Operating System (2023–2025)
**Role:** Creator, Architect, Writer | Published in English, Japanese, and Chinese  
**Link:** github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/koun-graph

- Designed a recursive, node-based knowledge representation system where relationships are themselves nodes
- Developed a theoretical trust model based on node provenance: manual / AI / rule / sensor
- Defined modular architecture for deployable components: memory, task reasoning, AI proxy, file semantics
- Authored a full whitepaper (v1.0) with detailed architecture, use cases, and philosophical framework
- Integrated asymmetric encryption into identity/auth layers (KounID), and designed AI-to-AI relay protocol (KounLink)
- Presented system vision through diagrams, protocols, and multi-lingual documentation

*I believe that meaning is the next layer of computation. I seek to contribute to teams that value cognition, system design, and long-term alignment between humans and AI.*
